Description: This is the R API for the 'nfer' formalism (<http://nfer.io/>).
    'nfer' was developed to specify event stream abstractions for spacecraft 
    telemetry such as the Mars Science Laboratory.  Users write rules using 
    a syntax that borrows heavily from Allen's Temporal Logic that, when 
    applied to an event stream, construct a hierarchy of temporal intervals 
    with data.  The R API supports loading rules from a file or mining them 
    from historical data.  Traces of events or pools of intervals are 
    provided as data frames.
